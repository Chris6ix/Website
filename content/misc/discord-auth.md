## Enter your bot's client ID

Once you've created your bot at the Discord Developers site, enter your client ID into the box below (you should have
copied this from step two of the [setup guide](/docs/2.x/Discord-Tutorial)).

Once you enter your client ID into the box below, clicking **Authorize** will redirect you to Discord's website. From
here, you'll be able to select from any server you have the **Manage Server** permission in to add it in. Once you've
added the bot to a server, you can continue the next step in the setup guide.
